# Parental Investment and Child Development
This program produces graphs of self-productivity, cross-productivity, dynamic complementarity between investments and cognitive skills for my Ph.D paper: Parental Investment and Child Development.

Data:
1. Factors.csv contains the grid of values of factors (cognitive skills, noncognitive skills, health and investment which are individual-specifically, randomly drawn from the estimated distributions of these factors.
2. Deciles1.csv contains the deciles of the factors individual-specifically, randomly drawn from the estimated distributions of these factors without investment factor.
3. Deciles2.csv contains the deciles of the factors individual-specifically, randomly drawn from the estimated distributions of these factors with investment factor. 
4. Coefs.csv contains the estimated coefficients.
5. Xcescfmean.csv contains means of endowments to be used as inputs in the functions.
You need to change the directories to your own specifications in order to run the files.
